Creating Tables:
----------------
1. Table gives structure to tabular data - data made of rows and columns - we dont want to use table for entire page layout

2. Table doesnt automatically occupy the full width of the page like aside or paragraph element - It only expands to contain the content within the table and appends margin for the rest of the width
