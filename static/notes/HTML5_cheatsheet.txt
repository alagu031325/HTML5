Semantic HTML Tags:
------------------
A semantic element clearly describes the meaning of its content to both the browser and the developer 

Semantic/HTML 5 elements that define different parts of the web page:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. <section> - A section is a grouping of content, typically with a heading - A web page normally be split into different sections such as introduction, content and contact information

2. <article> - specifies independent and self-contained content - it should make sense on its own like a forum/blog posts, product cards, news paper article

NOTE: We can nest <section> elements within <article> element and <article> elements within <section> element.

3. <header> - represents a container for introductory content or for a set of navigational links. We can have several header elements within one HTML document but we cant have header elements within footer, address or another header element.

4. <footer> - defines a footer for a document or section. We can have several footer elements in one document - it can contain copyrights/contact info or sitemap, back to top links and links to related documents

5. <nav> - defines a set of navigational links - it is only for major group of navigational links

6. <aside> - defines some content/complementary text which is not as important as the main content - should be indirectly related to the surrounding content 

7. <figure> - specifies self-contained content like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings - It contains two elements - <img> element holds the actual image/illustration and <figcaption> element defines a caption for the <figure> - figcaption can be the first or last element of the figure element

8. <details> - defines additional details that the user can view or hide - It goes together with summary element which defines the visible heading of the details element and p tag which defines the additional details itself
